Electric.js
==========

An open-source circuit simulator, designed for use with HTML5 canvas.

##No, really, what is it?

Electric.js was created to solve the problem of creating a browser-based circuit-sim for a
website [(Big Huge Breadboard)](https://bighugebreadboard.com) designed to
teach people electronics.  Other circuit-sims available through the browser have been created, but they were all
clearly designed for people who knew what they were doing, and they were proprietary in nature, so it was infeasible
to take one of these existing sims and modify them.  Thus, a new one was built, from the ground up.

What makes it different than the others?  Well, basically, it's open source, under the Mozilla Public License
(MPL).  It's also built with a focus on users who have little to no experience with circuit design, so it's light
on the "expert features".  Could Electric.js incorporate some of these features in the future?  Well, the likelihood
increases the longer people keep using it.

There's also some pretty goofy pixel-art style graphics used in conjuction with Electric.js at Big Huge Breadboard,
but those are under a different license (technically, just default copyright, but I'm looking at a CC license), and so
for the sake of reducing confusion (or increasing it) I've decided not to include those images for the time being.

More details will be added in due time.
